# AgroSense – Smart Agriculture System

## Overview
**AgroSense** is a smart agriculture system designed to support farmers and users with data-driven insights for better crop management. The system combines machine learning and web technologies to assist in plant disease detection and intelligent irrigation decision-making.

The project focuses on improving agricultural productivity by enabling early disease identification and efficient water usage through predictive analysis.

## Objectives
- Detect plant diseases at an early stage using image-based analysis  
- Assist farmers with actionable recommendations for crop health  
- Optimize irrigation decisions based on environmental and predictive data  
- Provide a simple and accessible web-based interface  

## Key Modules

### 1. Plant Disease Detection
- Image-based detection of plant diseases using deep learning  
- Uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2  
- Identifies disease type and provides causes, symptoms, and treatment suggestions  

### 2. Smart Irrigation Support
- Predictive analysis based on environmental parameters  
- Helps determine optimal watering requirements  
- Aims to reduce water wastage and improve crop sustainability  

### 3. Web Application Interface
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results  
- Backend processing using Flask  
- Designed for easy integration and future expansion  

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Web Framework:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Database:** SQLite / CSV-based data handling  
- **Dataset:** PlantVillage Dataset  


## How the System Works
1. User accesses the AgroSense web application  
2. Uploads a plant leaf image for disease detection  
3. The ML model processes the image and predicts disease status  
4. System displays disease details and recommendations  
5. Irrigation module assists in water-related decision-making  

## Use Cases
- Farmers monitoring crop health  
- Students learning applied machine learning in agriculture  
- Academic demonstration of AI-based agriculture systems  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time data collection  
- Mobile application support  
- Cloud deployment for scalability  
- Support for additional crops and regional datasets
